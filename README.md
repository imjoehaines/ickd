A simple to do list for World of Warcraft

ickd is a really simple to do list addon. It stores individual to do lists per character and does nothing else. Simple, see?

You've probably seen a bunch of different addons for note taking but all of them seem to have a bunch of extra features on top - lua parsers, graphic interfaces, player notes and the like. Useful stuff, sure, but not really what I wanted so I made this addon. If you've ever forgotten where you put that vanity item or what exactly you were planning on using all that cloth for, you'll probably find ickd useful.

###Usage

ickd works using the slash command /td and:
* **list** - lists the tasks on your to do list
* **add** <a task> - adds a new task to your list
* **remove** <task number> - removes a task from your list (get the number with the **list** command)
* edit <task number> <edited task> - edits an existing task on your list (get the number with the list command)
* **clear** - clears your list
* **help** - lists all available commands ingame

All commands will work with just their first letter (a = add, l = list etc...)

And that's it!
